# U.U.F.O.-Full-Album-in-Clone-Hero
When was the last time you saw a UFO?
When was the last time you saw a UMA?
What about crop circles?
Do you like "urban legends"?
With the end of the 00's and 10's, they have returned â€“ people's forgotten folklore: urban legends. But now they are back as Ultra Urban Legends, led by U.U.F.O. / Ultra UFO.
Creepy, weird, strange and mysterious. It's full of songs that are even fun, light-hearted, and funny.
All the songs are composed by composer, Camellia, mainly focused on hardcore and bass music, and many tracks (some are not) on the theme of urban legends from Japan, and abroad.
In addition, there are many guest musicians, even featuring streamer BTMC (ex-BeasttrollMC). New fire tracks featured RichaadEB as a guitarist, The8BitDrummer as a drummer, and a featuring track with Toby Fox, creator of Undertale and Deltarune.
Bonus tracks include "THE MUZZLE FACING (Long muzzled version)" from WACCA and five tracks from Arcaea, including "#1f1e33 (#00102g version)".
The U.U.F.O. invades the earth with ultra monstrous sound waves!

-a quote i stole from last.fm lol

This was a project I started a while ago, maybe 3-4 months. Camellia made a 27 track album called U.U.F.O., and I wanted a real challenge with charting, so here we are.
