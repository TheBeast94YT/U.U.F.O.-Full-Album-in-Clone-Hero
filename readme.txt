get ur AcaiBOPs ready, because this album is probably one of the best albums made by Camellia God. Also if brown man ever plays this, just know that its fine to take breaks.

if you have a keen eye, you probably saw the difficulty pie chart numbers. you may think it isnt acurate, but i found this website that helped me with it.
